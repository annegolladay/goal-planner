This bitcoin prediction tracker app was created to demonstrate what I have learned as a student at DevMountain by building a full stack application.

This app allows the user to make bitcoin price predictions daily, view current bitcoin prices as well as track all data, past data, and create notes on the predictions.

Technologies used for this project: React Node PostgreSQL Express.
